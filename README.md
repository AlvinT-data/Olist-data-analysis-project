# Olist-data-analysis-project
This project showcases the end-to-end process of building a data warehouse in Microsoft SQL Server using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) to perform ETL, data modeling and publishing insights through Tableau Public.
The dataset comes from the Brazilian Olist E-Commerce Public Dataset, which contains multiple related tables covering orders, customers, sellers, products, payments, reviews, and geolocation.
